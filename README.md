## What is Pymavlink 

Pymavlink is a python library that helps facilitate mavlink comminication between a python application and a mavlink autopilot or GCS. There are other alternatives for communicating mavlink in python.

### Python Libraries 


- Drone Kit 
Drone kit has been a popular python library for writing drone applications. It is built off of py mavlink and provides a few more functions on top of pymavlink to help make developing your applications easier. Drone Kit was developed by 3DR, but 3DR went bankrupt in 2016 and since drone kit gets minimal support. This can be an issue since over time more mavlink messages are added to the mavlink language which requires updaing drone kit. In addition since drone kit provides combinations of mavlink transactions to enable higher level functions, the concept of opperation can change in the autopilot firmware which breaks the functionality.  Because there are very minimal people maintaining drone kit, there is likely to be some features broken.

- MAVSDK 

MAVSDK is an exciting project that also provides higher level macro functions similar to drone kit. MAVSDK is actively being maintained by the Dronecode foundation which is the foundation that oversees QGroundcontrol and works closely with the PX4 community. Unfortunetly, MAVSDK is primarily designed to work with PX4 and use with Ardupilot is a use at your own risk deal. I am exited to try this library in the future, but as a primarily Ardupilot user I am hesitant to start using MAVSDK.

- MAVROS

MAVROS is a library that provides a translation between mavlink protocol to ROS messages. This can be a good option for developers who really want to live in a ROS enviorment. One draw back I have found to using MAVROS is that sometimes it is hard to figure out how the ROS messages translate to mavlink messages. There are minimal docs for mavros, which can be a barrier to entry, but I have done turorials on my Youtube channel on MAVROS and also a offer a python version of the iq_gnc funnctions which are designed on top of mavros.

- Pymavlink 

pymavlink is a library that wraps the autogenerated mavlink messages from the mavlink messages XMLs. I provides minimal high macro functions and is very closed to purely handling the communication at a protocol level. I enjoy using mavlink since it helps me better understand the communcation that goes on between a mavlink systems. It also has the least chance of breaking because it very close to the actual mavlink messages. 


## IQ Cloud Simulation

I will be launcting a cloud based simulator very soon. It will help developers stream line their simulation setup. I will make mixing of autopilot versions and model types very easy.
