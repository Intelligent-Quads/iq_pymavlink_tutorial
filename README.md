## What is Pymavlink 

Pymavlink is a python library that helps facilitate mavlink comminication between a python application and a mavlink autopilot or GCS. There are other alternatives for communicating mavlink in python.

### Drone Python Libraries 


- Drone Kit 
Drone kit has been a popular python library for writing drone applications. It is built off of py mavlink and provides a few more functions on top of pymavlink to help make developing your applications easier. Drone Kit was developed by 3DR, but 3DR went bankrupt in 2016 and since drone kit gets minimal support. This can be an issue since over time more mavlink messages are added to the mavlink language which requires updaing drone kit. In addition since drone kit provides combinations of mavlink transactions to enable higher level functions, the concept of opperation can change in the autopilot firmware which breaks the functionality.  Because there are very minimal people maintaining drone kit, there is likely to be some features broken.

- MAVSDK 

MAVSDK is an exciting project that provides higher level macro functions. MAVSDK is actively being maintained by the Dronecode foundation which is the foundation that oversees QGroundcontrol and works closely with the PX4 community. MAVSDK is primarily designed to work with PX4 and use with Ardupilot is a "use at your own risk" deal.

- MAVROS

MAVROS is a library that provides a translation between mavlink protocol to ROS messages. This can be a good option for developers who really want to live in a ROS enviorment. One draw back using MAVROS is that sometimes it is hard to figure out how the ROS messages translate to mavlink messages.

- Pymavlink 

Pymavlink is a library that wraps the autogenerated mavlink messages from the mavlink messages XMLs. It provides minimal high macro functions and is very closed to purely handling the communication at a protocol level. Pymavlink can be good for understanding the communcation that goes on between mavlink systems. Since pymavlink has minimal high level functionality it your application relies less on other peoples implementations of high level functions


## IQ Cloud Simulation

I will be launcting a cloud based simulator very soon. It will help developers stream line their simulation setup. I will make mixing of autopilot versions and model types very easy.
